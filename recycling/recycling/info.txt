Information about Waste Recycling

Glass, plastic, and paper product recycling is common across the country, but while other materials are equally recyclable, they are often discarded because people don't know how to recycle them.

This is where our project comes in. Volunteers transport used oil and batteries to a Waste Center so that they can be reused, decreasing the amount of what we throw away and our impact on the environment.
